title: Welcome to Nordic CHI 2021
---

Hello CHI friends,

Following good old Nordic tradition, we will have an open bar party for everyone. This year, the free cocktails and pints will be virtual on [gather.town](https://gather.town).

You are all welcome to join us and meet old/new friends, chat with each other, and maybe play a game or two! Everyone's invited so tell your friends ðŸ¥³

## When? 
Doors open at **22:30 JST on 11 May (Tuesday)**, right after [Ruha Benjamin's keynote](https://programs.sigchi.org/chi/2021/program/content/57590).
Check your local start time: https://dateful.com/eventlink/2676830202.

The virtual party has no closing time or curfews. We will keep them open for the entire CHI week so you can drop in and gather around at any time! 

## Where and How?
The party will be hosted on [https://gather.town](gather.town), virtual spaces where groups of people can meet and hang-out. Get your camera and microphone ready, grab a refreshing drink or snack, and join the fun! Click on one of the bar links below, pick and customise your avator, and you're ready to go! Move around bars freely, and chat with anyone you run into! We'll also set up spaces with group games like Pictionary and (https://codenames.game)[Codenames].
