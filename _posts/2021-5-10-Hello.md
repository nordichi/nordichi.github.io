Hello CHI fellows,

Same as previous years, we will have an open bar party for all using gather town.

Welcome to join us, chat, and meet old/new friends! 

## When? 
Party time: 

The bars will be opened for the whole CHI week even after the party. 

## Where and How?
The party will be hosted on Gather Town. Get your camera and microphone ready. Click one of the bar links, pick your avator, then you're ready to go! Move around in the bars freely, and chat to anyone you run into!

## Bar links?
Because there is a number limit of 25 people in each bar (sad), we booked 12 bars for the party (fit 300 people in total)! 
Feel free click any of link below or switch between bars. If all bars are full, we will open new ones.
